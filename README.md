Inventor-Addin
==============

This is test for the project for anisotropic geometric feature patterning on higly curved surfaces

Here is the code and the examples for my project under inventor API.
Your suggestion cut time drastically, from 11 minutes for 119 features to 1.2 minutes for the same model.

Please check if I it is possible to make more improvements, check the method : ButtonDefinition_OnExecute(NameValueMap context) in the AddSlotOptionButton.cs class.
or your name in the project, it points where the bottleneck I think happens.

> You need to add the folder named CMUdata to : C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor 2014 and the thirdparty library Math.Net to the BIN folder.

> The addin is part of the TOOLS TAB.

Just press the button in the Anisotropic tab and it should start.
